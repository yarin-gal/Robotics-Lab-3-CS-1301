# Robotics-Lab-3-CS-1301
In this lab, my partner and I were tasked with having our iRobot do two things: "Autonomously deliver" itself to a specific location on a coordinate grid while avoiding objects in its path, and a "Maze solver", where the robot has to make intelligent decisions to escape a maze all by itself, without previous knowledge of the layout of the maze.
